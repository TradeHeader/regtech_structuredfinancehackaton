# {project name}

Short blurb about what your project does.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install my-crazy-module --save
```

Windows:

```sh
edit autoexec.bat
```

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your project can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially screenshots / videos ([LiceCap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is great for this kind of thing).

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```

## Roadmap

List the roadmap steps; alternatively link the Confluence Wiki page where the project roadmap is published.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. ....

## Contributing

**All commits** must be signed with a DCO signature to avoid being flagged by the DCO Bot. This means that your commit log message must contain a line that looks like the following one, with your actual name and email address:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` will add that line automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information
